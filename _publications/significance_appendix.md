<b> Abstract </b>
Statistical significance testing plays an important role when drawing conclusions from
experimental results in NLP papers. Particularly, it is a valuable tool when one would like to
establish the superiority of one algorithm over another. Th
is appendix complements the guide for testing statistical significance in NLP presented in Dror et al. (2018), by proposing valid statistical tests for the common tasks and evaluation measures in the field.
