Education
======
* (2016-present) Ph.D. student at the faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion, working under the supervision of Asst. Professor Roi Reichart. 

My research involves building and investigating algorithms for structured prediction, with a focus on algorithms for NLP applications. I am also interested in statistically sound evaluation of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks. I am interested in NLP, machine learning, statistics, probability, operation research and optimization. Current GPA: 93.5.

* (2014-2016) Master in Operation Research for completing the requirements for the Master's degree during the PhD studies, Technion.
* (2010-2014) B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management, Business Information Systems major, Technion. Graduated Cum Laude. 4 Dean's Honor Rolls. GPA: 87.9.
