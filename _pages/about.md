I am an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) at the <a href =  "https://is-web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/">Department of Information Systems</a>, <a href = "https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en">University of Haifa</a>. My research lies at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and statistical methodology, with a strong emphasis on developing statistically sound practices for empirical evaluation. 
I completed my Ph.D. at the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology under the supervision of <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Prof. Roi Reichart</a>, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship with <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/">Prof. Dan Roth</a> at the University of Pennsylvania's <a href = "https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/">Cognitive Computation Group</a>.

My work focuses on enhancing the statistical rigor of model evaluation, particularly in NLP. I develop methodologies that improve the reliability, fairness, and interpretability of empirical results and generated text outputs by NLP models such as LLMs, helping researchers draw more robust and trustworthy conclusions from experimental data.

I am currently searching for enthusiastic students eager to delve into research in areas such as natural language processing and statistics.
I completed my Postdoctoral Research at the <a href = "https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/">Cognitive Computation Group</a> at the <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Department of Computer and Information Science</a>, <a href = "https://home.www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, Working with <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/">Prof. Dan Roth</a>.
I completed my Ph.D. in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Prof. Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. My doctoral thesis, titled "Structured Solutions in Natural Language Processing: Algorithms and Statistically Sound Evaluation," explored innovative approaches to structured prediction algorithms and statistical evaluation of them.--->
