I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href = "https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/">Cognitive Computation Group< /a> at the < href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Department of Computer and Information Science< /a>, <a href = "https://home.www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania< /a>. I am working with <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/">Prof. Dan Roth< /a>.

I have completed my Ph.D. in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. My thesis was about Structured Solutions in Natural Language Processing: Algorithms and Statistically Sound Evaluation. 

My research involves building and investigating algorithms for structured prediction, with a focus on algorithms for NLP applications. I am interested in NLP, machine learning, statistics, probability, operation research and optimization.
