I am a PhD Student in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. 

My research involves building and investigating algorithms for structured prediction, with a focus on algorithms for NLP applications. I am interested in NLP, machine learning, statistics, probability, operation research and optimization.
