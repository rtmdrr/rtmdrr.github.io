I am an Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer) at the <a href =  "https://is-web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/">Department of Information Systems</a>, <a href = "https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en">University of Haifa</a>. I am currently searching for enthusiastic students eager to delve into research in areas such as natural language processing and statistics.

I completed my Postdoctoral Research at the <a href = "https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/">Cognitive Computation Group</a> at the <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Department of Computer and Information Science</a>, <a href = "https://home.www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, Working with <a href = "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/">Prof. Dan Roth</a>.
I completed my Ph.D. in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Prof. Roi Reichart</a>, at the <a href = "http://ie.technion.ac.il">Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management</a> at the <a href = "http://www.technion.ac.il">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>. My doctoral thesis, titled "Structured Solutions in Natural Language Processing: Algorithms and Statistically Sound Evaluation," explored innovative approaches to structured prediction algorithms and statistical evaluation of them.

<!--- My research involves building and investigating algorithms for structured prediction, with a focus on algorithms for NLP applications. I am interested in NLP, machine learning, statistics, probability, operation research and optimization.--->

My research involves developing statistically sound methodologies for empirical investigation and evaluation for Data Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing applications. My research vision appears <a href= >here</a>.
