I am a PhD Student in the Natural Language Processing Group, supervised by Roi Reichart, at the faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. 

My research involves building and investigating algorithms for structured prediction, with a focus on algorithms for NLP applications. I am interested in NLP, machine learning, statistics, probability, operation research and optimization.
